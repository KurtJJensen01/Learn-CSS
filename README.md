# Learn CSS - Codecademy

This repository contains my code and exercises from the [Codecademy Learn CSS course](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-css) as well as the [Learn CSS Box Model and Layout course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css-box-model-and-layout).

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Overview

The content is divided into two main parts:

1. **Learn CSS** (âœ… Completed)  
2. **CSS Box Model and Layout** (âœ… Completed)

âœ… = Completed

Iâ€™ll continue adding projects and exercises as I progress through both courses!

## ðŸš€ About the Courses

- CSS syntax, selectors, and specificity  
- Styling text, colors, and backgrounds  
- CSS box model fundamentals: margin, border, padding, and content
